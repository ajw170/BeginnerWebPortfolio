					<h2><a href="./assign1/index.html">Assignment 1</a></h2>
					<p>This assignment served to establish our online ePortfolio for the course.  
						We first established our <strong>folder structure</strong> on the server.  The page you are currently reading
						is on our root directory and all subsequent assignments will live in sub-directories.</p>
					<p>The assignment first directed us to create two web pages using manually typed html.  The first
					   was this page that you're reading, and the second was the "About Me" page that will help the class
					   get to know me better.  The HTML was very basic and utilized basic tags with a few attributes
					   thrown in for demonstration purposes.  The beauty of the web is that every web page, no matter how complex,
					   is composed of a series of relatively <strong>simple HTML tags</strong>.</p>
	 				<p><u>What really gives life to the internet is CSS</u>.  The latter portion of the assignment had us take the
	 				   two HTML pages and link them to an external style sheet, which we also created manually.  The style sheet formed the basis of all fonts,
	 				   colors, margins, table configurations, list configurations, and so on.  CSS is extremely powerful in styling
	 				   web pages down to the finest detail.  It is also versatile--if I decide to completely change the look
	 				   and feel of my web page at a later date, I do not need to touch the HTML code at all, but rather just the CSS.
	 				   I now have a much better understanding of the <strong>relationship</strong> between HTML and CSS.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Establish the online ePortfolio and become familiarized with the web server structure</li>
						<li>Create two simple HTML documents using a variety of tags and attributes for learning purposes</li>
						<li>Create a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to standardize the look and feel of the current and future assignments in our ePortfolio. </li>
						<li>Become familiarized with the relationship between HTML and CSS in a hands-on, purposeful way</li>
					</ul>

					<h2><a href="./assign2/index.html">Assignment 2</a></h2>
					<p>This assignment was all about <strong>JavaScript</strong> and how it interacts with HTML and CSS.  We also had an introductory look and <strong>flowcharts
						for structured programming</strong>, which help us to visually identify the logical flow of a program.</p>
					<p>The assignment first directed us to hone our knowledge of JavaScript, which included a detailed explanation of the DOM (Document Object Model).  The DOM is the 
						logical structure of an HTML document.  Each element is a "node" and a node can have parent nodes, child nodes, and sibling nodes.  Understanding this
						structure is critical to effectively leverage JavaScript to its maximum benefit.</p>
					<p>We used our new knowledge of JavaScript to construct a simple program that reads inputs from an HTML form and outputs a result.  In my case, I created a "pizza profiler"
					   whereby the user answers questions about their preferences for pizza.  The program takes these answers and outputs a profile based on the responses.  We also utilized JavaScript
					   to validate the program inputs. If the user enters an invalid value, JavaScript will change the corresponding HTML element to call the user's attention to it in an intuitive way.
					     Take a look by navigating to <strong>Assignment 2</strong>!</p>
					<p>Finally, we mapped our program out visually using a structured programming flowchart.  Creating the chart was instrumental in solidifying my understanding of
						decision symbols, flow symbols, input/output symbols, calculation symbols, and connectors.  They're not just pretty boxes anymore!</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn the basics of JavaScript</li>
						<li>Understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS elements and navigates an HTML document</li>
						<li>Create a simple program that leverages JavaScript to validate user inputs and calculate a result based on those inputs</li>
						<li>Develop a feel for structured programming flowcharts by creating a flowchart that maps the execution of the aforementioned program</li>
					</ul>

					<h2><a href="./assign3/index.html">Assignment 3</a></h2>
					<p>This assignment continued our focus on <strong>JavaScript</strong>, specifically statistical methods using
					both pre-existing and customized functions.  The exercise helped us understand how the various functions work
					for frequently required tasks such as text parsing, regular expressions, and accurate mathematical calculations.</p>
					<p>It was critical to understand that JavaScript treats arrays as text values when reading in user-entered numbers.  This
					consideration required the <strong>parsing</strong> of the items with the appropriate method.</p>
					<p>Lastly, we created a <strong>test harness</strong> using Excel for program validation.  Mismatched results would indicate a
					 problem with the JavaScript and proved very helpful in isolating issues.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand how to parse user input and format it according to the requirements of the program</li>
						<li>Understand how arrays work in JavaScript as well as how to use control structures to access and modify elements</li>
						<li>Utilize built in JavaScript mathematical functions for use within user-defined functions</li>
						<li>Develop a testing method using Excel to validate the program's output</li>

					<h2><a href="./assign4/index.html">Assignment 4</a></h2>
					<p>This assignment is all about powerful <strong>Canvas animations</strong> using JavaScript.  The exercise leverages available features of animations
					to animate a concept.  In this case, the concept was chosen to be the force of gravity, specifically, how gravity
					causes what we know as orbit.</p>
					<p>The animation included various colors, meaningful text (without being excessive), various shapes, and motion.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand how canvas animations work using JavaScript</li>
						<li>Determine the best visual elements to use to convey a desired message or concept</li>
						<li>Incorporate the use of specific motions, colors, and text to foster high level understanding of a complex concept</li>
						<li>Investigate potential alternative forms of achieving the same animation</li>

					<h2><a href="./assign5/index.php">Assignment 5</a></h2>
					<p>This was our first PHP assignment.  This assignment was critical in solidifying our understanding of how
                                        client side and server side code interact.  The server is able to send html to the client browser to display whatever
                                        needs to be displayed depending on the particular situation.  The source code in the browser does not show any of the
                                        server side code, which is by design.</p>
					<p>The concepts learned in this assignment are critical to understanding client/server web applications and will be critical
                                        in future assignments involving databases.</p>
                                        <p>For this assignment, we implemented a dynamic address book that authenticates the user via a login.

                                                <li>Become acquainted with user authentication mechanisms</li>

					<h2><a href="./assign6/index.php">Assignment 6</a></h2>
					<p>This assignment built on the concepts learned in Assignment by introducing the mySQL database as
                                        the holder of information.</p>
                                        <p>In the previous assignment, a simple text file held the information and required
                                        great care with updating and retrieving information so as to not disturb the specific required structure.
                                        In this assignment, all data was accessed using PHP's database access methods, namely mySQLi.  The concepts
                                        introduced included retrieving, adding, deleting, and updating the information using HTML forms.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand the fundamentals of mySQL databases</li>
                                                <li>Develop  methods to programmatically access and interact with the database using PHP</li>
                                                <li>Utilize HTML forms in combination with PHP and database queries to display relevant information in a
                                                structured way</li>
