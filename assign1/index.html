					<h2>About Andrew</h2>
					<h3>The Past</h3>
					<p>I was born in suburban southern New Jersey in 1989.  I was an imaginative child
					and would always look to pull my friends and family into whatever adventure I had concocted at the time.  The most memorable moment was when I transformed our house 
					into a functional hotel complete with placards, room service, and direct phone access to the
					front desk which was manned by either me or my sister.  I was also a talented swimmer throughout
					my childhood and adolescence; I continued with this through the end of High School on the varsity team.  After
					graduating High School in 2007, I attended <font color="blue">Duke University</font> where I studied Civil and Environmental
					Engineering until graduating in 2011.  I promptly moved into the workforce but decided that the Civil
					Engineering field wasn't suited to my aspirations.  However, I still maintain strong interest in environmental
					topics.
					</p>

					<h3>The Present</h3>
					<p><img src="./Andrew.png" alt="Andrew Wood" 
						style="float:right; height:180px;width:auto;margin:10px">
					I am presently working in Miami, FL at a major global cruise line as an IT analyst.  The role combines
					aspects of project management, business requirements gathering and analysis, system architecture design,
					and digital product roadmap development.  It is a versatile role that affords me great opportunities including
					the ability to travel around the globe.  Since I work within the shipboard division of IT, I often find myself
					flying to far away places to work one of our many system deployments and upgrades.</p>
					<p>In addition to my professional career, I'm also pursing a second bachelor's degree in <font color="orange">Computer Science</font> (I assume the majority reading this are as well).  By doing 
					so, I hope to augment my technical skills which I believe will help me in my career endeavors.  Looking back,
					I probably should have majored in CS at Duke as the field is more aligned with my skills and interests.  I'm glad
					to be finally pursuing that goal.  Onward!</p>
					</div>
					<h3>The Future</h3>
					<p>In the future, I see myself involved in some sort of entrepreneurial venture, although the specifics are still
					unclear for me.  I'm always thinking about what could be that next viable "idea".  I think the entrepreneurial route suits my independent mindset;
					in my view it is the only way to true independence.  I soon hope to get involved in local start-ups to get a feel for working environments outside of the corporate world
					while still keeping my day job). Overall, I  am living life to the fullest and trying to enjoy every day of it.  You
					never know which will be your last! </p>
